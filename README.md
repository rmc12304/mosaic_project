# mosaic_project
This is a project aiming to develop a photo mosaic tool using Python

The idea is to provide a simple and effective way of creating beautiful photo mosaic collages with a reduced input and manual work by the user.

In release 0.1 a script was implemented to pick any image and, after input of 2 x 2 dimensions, create a collage with small samples of the original image. See examples below:
